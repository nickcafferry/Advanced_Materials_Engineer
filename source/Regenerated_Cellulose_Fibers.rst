Introduction
============

There are four major types of regenerated celluose or cellusore-derived fiber:

* Viscose
* Lyocell
* Cupro
* Acetate

Fiber Characterization
-----------------------

Fiber analyses generally followed the same procedures reported elsewhere (Megiatto et al. 2008; Ramires et al. 2010). Some details were as follows.

The :strong:`fiber moisture content` was determined by the method described by ABNT (Brazilian Association for Technical Standards) NBR 9656, which consists of determining the percentage difference between the initial weight of the sample (1.0g) and that after 4h drying at 105 degree celcius. 

The :strong:`ash content` was determined by considering the difference between the initial weight of dried fibers and that after calcination for 4h at 800 degree celcius.

The :strong:`Klason ligin content` was determined as specified in the TAPPI standard T13m-54. This method is based on the isolation of ligin after polysaccharide hydrolysis and the dissolution with concentrated sulfuric acid (Synth, 72%).

The :strong:`holocellulose content` was determined, as described in TAPPI T19m-54, by the selective degradation of the ligin polymer by sodium hypochlorite at 70 degree celcius. 

The :strong:`celluose content` was determined by the removal of hemicelluose form the hoolcelluose with NaOH, as specified in TAPPI T19m-54.

The :strong:`hemicelluose content` was then calculated by substracting the celluose content from the holocelluose content. The analyses were performed in triplicate.
