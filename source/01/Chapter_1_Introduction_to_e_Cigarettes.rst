Introduction to e-Cigarettes
============================

e-Cigarettes were recently invented and developed as an alternative-to-smoking method of nicotine intake. They are electronic devices with three main parts: a battery, an atomizer composed of a wick and metal coil, and a liquid (“e-liquid”) stored inside the atomizer. The function is to aerosolize the liquid, producing a visible aerosol which the user inhales. This is achieved by heating the metal coil inside the atomizer by an electrical current from the battery. e-Cigarettes are commonly called electronic nicotine-delivery devices (ENDS). However, because they can be used with non-nicotine e-liquids, the term ENDS is inaccu- rate and does not represent the whole spectrum of e-Cigarette devices and use patterns.

INVENTION AND EVOLUTION OF e-CIGARETTES
=======================================

e-Cigarettes were invented by Hon Lik, a pharmacist from China. The initial patent was filed in 2004 in China and in 2005 in the United States Patent Office (application number 10/587,707). The patent was published in 2007. The principle of e-Cigarette function, the evaporation of liquid and delivery of aerosol to the user, can be tracked back to patents published decades earlier. In 1930, a patent was published by the US Patent Office describing an electric vaporizer “for holding medicinal compounds which are electrically or otherwise heated to produce vapors for inhalation.” Another patent in 1934 described a therapeutic apparatus that was “adapted for transforming volatile liquid medicaments into vapors or into mists of exceedingly fine particles.” A similar patent was published in 1936. These cases referred to vaporization for therapeutic applications. However, a patent filed by Herbert A. Gilbert and published in 1965 was titled “Smokeless non-tobacco cigarette” and described a battery-operated device “to provide a safe and harmless means for and method of smoking by replacing burning tobacco and paper with heated, moist, flavored air.” The term e-Cigarette includes a very diverse line of products, with different design, functional, and performance characteristics. Although there is still no consensus on terminology, the products available on the market are mainly of three types
