Introduction to e-Cigarettes
============================

e-Cigarettes were recently invented and developed as an alternative-to-smoking method of nicotine intake. They are electronic devices with three main parts: a battery, an atomizer composed of a wick and metal coil, and a liquid (“e-liquid”) stored inside the atomizer. The function is to aerosolize the liquid, producing a visible aerosol which the user inhales. This is achieved by heating the metal coil inside the atomizer by an electrical current from the battery. e-Cigarettes are commonly called electronic nicotine-delivery devices (ENDS). However, because they can be used with non-nicotine e-liquids, the term ENDS is inaccu- rate and does not represent the whole spectrum of e-Cigarette devices and use patterns.
