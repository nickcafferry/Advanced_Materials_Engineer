Exposures to e-Cigarette Vapor
==============================

This chapter presents a review of published data and new data collected by RTI International to provide the reader :strong:`a perspective on the sources and external factors that influence the magnitude of exposure to e-Cigarette vapor`.The author reviewed over 100 published articles from the e-Cigarette, conventional cigarette, and aerosol science fields. Articles were selected that have data to help :strong:`advance our understanding of user, secondary, and tertiary exposures`. Although the cited literature in this chapter is limited, the number of published papers focused on e-Cigarette vapor exposures continues to increase annually. As such,the literature review was limited to those published before August 1, 2016. A note on terminology: Vapors includes both the particles and gases produced by an e-Cigarette. Particles and aerosols are used synonymously following the definition by Hinds: “An aerosol is defined in its simplest form as a collection of solid or liquid particles in a gas.”1

Introduction
---------------

This chapter discusses the physical and chemical changes in e-Cigarette vapor during inhalation and exhalation by the user. The vapor properties span aerosol and gas phases, and the chemical concentration. These factors influence the nicotine and flavoring dose received by the user and exhaled leading to secondhand exposure. The physical and chemical processes will be supported by published theortical and em
